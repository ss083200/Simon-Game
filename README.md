# Simon Game - Color Memory Game

This repository contains a Simon Game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to test their color memory by clicking on each color in the sequence they were presented, including the most recent color, which is randomly generated each turn.

The game is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The index.html file sets up the structure of the game, including the title, color buttons, and level display. The styles.css file provides the visual styling for the game elements, such as the background color, button appearance, and animation effects.

The game logic is implemented in the game.js file using JavaScript and jQuery. It handles user interactions, generates random color sequences, checks the player's input against the generated sequence, and updates the game level. Sound effects and visual animations enhance the gameplay experience.

To play the Simon Game, users start by pressing any key. The game then begins by showing the first color in the sequence. Players must click on the colors in the exact order they were presented, including the latest color added in each round. The game progresses to higher levels as the player successfully matches the color sequences. However, if the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they can restart by pressing any key.

This project demonstrates the use of front-end web technologies to create an interactive and engaging color memory game. Test your memory skills and challenge yourself to reach higher levels in this classic Simon Game implementation.
